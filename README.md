The emerald game constitutes of a player trying to collect the diamonds without encountering the aliens, the spaceship and the bugs. The game ends if all the diamonds are collected or if the player dies. If no dirt is beneath the stone, the stone falls until supported by the dirt. If the player is beneath the stone, he dies.
The game can be run from the terminal using bash. The player can be moved using the four keyboard arrows.
